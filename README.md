# Supplementary scripts for FLIC evaluation

This repository contains additional scripts used for the validation and benchmarking of FLIC, a tool developed for isoform reconstruction from long reads. These scripts enable comparisons between FLIC and existing tools, as well as accuracy assessments against reference isoforms. These scripts were created for the preparation of the article.
